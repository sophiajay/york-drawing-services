        <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.
            Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our
            business,
            then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the
        law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only
        permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

    <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We may transfer your personal data to countries outside the UK. If we do this, we will ensure that appropriate
        safeguards are in place to protect your personal data, such as ensuring that the recipient country has been
        deemed
        to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the UK government, or that we have entered into
        specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost,
        used,
        or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to
        those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
        process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
        applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
        including
        for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity
        of
        the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the
        purposes for which we process your personal data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
        and
        the applicable legal requirements.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in
        which
        case we may use such information without further notice to you.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Legal Rights</h2>
    <p>Under the UK GDPR, you have certain rights regarding your personal data:</p>

        <li><strong>The right to object:</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data

        <li><strong>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling:</strong> You have the right not to be
            subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal
